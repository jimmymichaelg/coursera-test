<h4>What are the security and privacy features of Apple iOS?</h4>
<div>iOS includes the following security features:</div>

<p>Apple ID support. Users can sign into websites and apps using their existing Apple ID. Additionally, iOS supports signing in using Face ID or Touch ID, which use biometric authentication methods. Apple IDs are protected with two-factor authentication.
Privacy and security. iOS supports fine-grained controls that prevent apps from gaining location information or accepting AirDrop content from unknown senders. Apps can also be blocked from using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth without users' permission. Additionally, iOS devices use a secure boot chain to ensure that only trusted (signed) code is executed during the boot process. This allows iOS devices to verify the integrity of any code running on the device.
Secure Enclave Support. Secure Enclave is a hardware-based feature that stores cryptographic keys in an isolated location to prevent those keys from being compromised. Secure Enclave is not exclusive to iOS devices. It also works with Apple TV, Apple Watch, Mac computers and other Apple products.</p>
